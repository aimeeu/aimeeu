# What I do now

I create:

- Developer-focused content that empowers developers to be self-sufficient. 
- Tutorials and user guides that exceed user expectations.
- API and CLI reference material that is clear and concise. 

# What I did before

I was a software developer and open source lead for many years before moving into full-time tech writing. I've always worked in a docs-as-code environment.

Open source projects:

- Acumos AI
- Apache Cassandra (tiny update to the docs)
- GitLab (small docs and handbook updates)
- Kubernetes
- OpenStack
- OPNFV
- Spinnaker
- vCluster

 Commercial products: 
 
 - Armory Continuous Deployment, an enterprise version of open source Spinnaker; on-prem and managed versions.
 - Armory Continuous Deployment-as-a-Service, a DevOps SaaS tool for declarative deployment to Kuberntes and AWS Lambda; created from scratch, **not** based on an existing open source project. This product is no longer available as of March, 2024. Harness acquired Armory in December, 2023, and marked Armory's products EOL.
 - vCluster Platform, an enterprise product for managing vCluster instances.
 - [HashiCorp Nomad](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs), a simple and flexible scheduler and orchestrator to deploy and manage containers and non-containerized applications across on-prem and clouds at scale.
