# What I do now

I create developer-focused content such as tutorials and user guides, as well as API and CLI reference material. 

# What I did before

I was a software developer and open source lead for many years before moving into full-time tech writing. I've always been in a docs-as-code environment.

Open source projects:

- Acumos AI
- Apache Cassandra (tiny update to the docs)
- Kubernetes
- OpenStack
- OPNFV
- Spinnaker
- vCluster

 Commercial products: 
 
 - Armory Continuous Deployment, an enterprise version of open source Spinnaker; on-prem and managed versions.
 - Armory Continuous Deployment-as-a-Service, a SaaS tool for declarative deployment to Kuberntes and AWS Lambda; created from scratch, **not** based on an existing open source project.
 - vCluster Platform, an enterprise version of vCluster.
